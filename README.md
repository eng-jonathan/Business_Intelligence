### [Energy Cost Analysis](https://github.com/eng-jonathan/Business_Intelligence/tree/main/cuny%20energy)
* [Presentation](https://github.com/eng-jonathan/Business_Intelligence/blob/main/CUNY%20Energy/CUNY%20Energy%20Presentation.pdf) | [PBIX File](https://github.com/eng-jonathan/Business_Intelligence/blob/main/CUNY%20Energy/CUNY%20Energy%20PBIX.pbix) 
* Designed ***Data Visualizations*** and ***Interactive Dashboards*** to create presentations on energy cost and analysis
* Developed in ***Microsoft Power BI*** and incorporates the use of ***DAX*** to create calculated columns, measures, and virtual tables, and ***M*** to create queries and shape data
* **Interesting Findings**:
  * Manhattan has an **Average Facility Amount**, however has the **Greatest Energy Usage** and is the **Least Energy Efficient** in its Cost/Facility-Count ratio
  * Brooklyn has the **Most Facility Amount**, however is the **Second-Least Energy Efficeint**
  * Bronx is the **Most Energy Efficient**
  * Queens is **Average** across the board in terms of Energy Usage, Cost, and Efficiency
  * Staten Island has the **Least Facility Amount** trailing second-least by ~40%, and is the **Second-Most Energy Efficient**

### Course Overview:
* [Syllabus](https://github.com/eng-jonathan/Business_Intelligence/blob/main/syllabus/syllabus.pdf)
* Research and dissect the visualizations, DAX code, Calculated columns and tables from various professional PBIX files
* Understanding the differences between traditional OLTP and columnar databases
* Client-side loading external data sources to form a client-side data warehouse that (ETL) (extract transform and load using PowerQuery (M)) evolving the creation of various staging queries to shape data efficiently into a BISM (Business Modeling Sematic Model) data model.
* Applying parallels from Relational database SQL skills to functional programming in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for PowerBI or PowerPivot.
* Data Analysis expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns, measures and virtual tables using skills learned within the prerequisites
* Create Pivot tables, Charts and Key Point Indicators (KPI)
* PowerBI Desktop and PowerPivot Excel 2019 or better to prototype BISM models
* Use techniques to slice and dice the decision support data to provide the macro to micro perspectives for the business user
* Building and implementing relational databases
